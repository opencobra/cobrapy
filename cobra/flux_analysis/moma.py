def add_moma(model):
    """Add constraints and objective representing a MOMA
    (minimization of metabolic adjustment) model.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    model : a cobra model

    Returns:
    --------
    Nothing.

    Notes
    -----

    In the original MOMA specification one looks for the flux distribution
    of the deletion (v^d) closest to the fluxes without the deletion (v).
    In math this means:

    minimize \sum_i (v^d_i - v_i)^2
    s.t. Sv^d = 0
         lb_i <= v^d_i <= ub_i

    Here, we use a variable transformation v^t := v^d_i - v_i. Substituting
    and using the fact that Sv = 0 gives:

    minimize \sum (v^t_i)^2
    s.t. Sv^d = 0
         v^t = v^d_i - v_i
         lb_i <= v^d_i <= ub_i

    So basically we just re-center the flux space at the old solution and than
    find the flux distribution closest to the new zero (center). This is the
    same strategy as used in cameo.

    The former objective function is saved in the optlang solver interface as
    "moma_old_objective" and this can be used to immediately extract the value
    of the former objective after MOMA optimization.
