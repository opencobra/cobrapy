    """
    Determine the minimum and maximum possible flux value for each reaction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model for which to run the analysis. It will *not* be modified.
    reaction_list : list of cobra.Reaction or str, optional
        The reactions for which to obtain min/max fluxes. If None will use
        all reactions in the model (default).
    loopless : boolean, optional
        Whether to return only loopless solutions. This is significantly
        slower. Please also refer to the notes.
    fraction_of_optimum : float, optional
        Must be <= 1.0. Requires that the objective value is at least the
        fraction times maximum objective value. A value of 0.85 for instance
        means that the objective has to be at least at 85% percent of its
        maximum.
    pfba_factor : float, optional
        Add an additional constraint to the model that requires the total sum
        of absolute fluxes must not be larger than this value times the
        smallest possible sum of absolute fluxes, i.e., by setting the value
        to 1.1 the total sum of absolute fluxes must not be more than
        10% larger than the pFBA solution. Since the pFBA solution is the
        one that optimally minimizes the total flux sum, the ``pfba_factor``
        should, if set, be larger than one. Setting this value may lead to
        more realistic predictions of the effective flux bounds.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        A data frame with reaction identifiers as the index and two columns:
        - maximum: indicating the highest possible flux
        - minimum: indicating the lowest possible flux

    Notes
    -----
    This implements the fast version as described in [1]_. Please note that
    the flux distribution containing all minimal/maximal fluxes does not have
    to be a feasible solution for the model. Fluxes are minimized/maximized
    individually and a single minimal flux might require all others to be
    suboptimal.

    Using the loopless option will lead to a significant increase in
    computation time (about a factor of 100 for large models). However, the
    algorithm used here (see [2]_) is still more than 1000x faster than the
    "naive" version using ``add_loopless(model)``. Also note that if you have
    included constraints that force a loop (for instance by setting all fluxes
    in a loop to be non-zero) this loop will be included in the solution.
