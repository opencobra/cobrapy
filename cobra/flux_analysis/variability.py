    """Runs flux variability analysis to find the min/max flux values for each
    each reaction in `reaction_list`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : a cobra model
        The model for which to run the analysis. It will *not* be modified.
    reaction_list : list of cobra.Reaction or str, optional
        The reactions for which to obtain min/max fluxes. If None will use
        all reactions in the model.
    loopless : boolean, optional
        Whether to return only loopless solutions. Ignored for legacy solvers,
        also see `Notes`.
    fraction_of_optimum : float, optional
        Must be <= 1.0. Requires that the objective value is at least
        fraction * max_objective_value. A value of 0.85 for instance means that
        the objective has to be at least at 85% percent of its maximum.
    pfba_factor : float, optional
        Add additional constraint to the model that the total sum of
        absolute fluxes must not be larger than this value times the
        smallest possible sum of absolute fluxes, i.e., by setting the value
        to 1.1 then the total sum of absolute fluxes must not be more than
        10% larger than the pfba solution. Since the pfba solution is the
        one that optimally minimizes the total flux sum, the pfba_factor
        should, if set, be larger than one. Setting this value may lead to
        more realistic predictions of the effective flux bounds.
    solver : str, optional
        Name of the solver to be used. If None it will respect the solver set
        in the model (model.solver).
    **solver_args : additional arguments for legacy solver, optional
        Additional arguments passed to the legacy solver. Ignored for
        optlang solver (those can be configured using
        model.solver.configuration).

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame with reaction identifier as the index columns

        - maximum: indicating the highest possible flux
        - minimum: indicating the lowest possible flux

    Notes
    -----
    This implements the fast version as described in [1]_. Please note that
    the flux distribution containing all minimal/maximal fluxes does not have
    to be a feasible solution for the model. Fluxes are minimized/maximized
    individually and a single minimal flux might require all others to be
    suboptimal.

    Using the loopless option will lead to a significant increase in
    computation time (about a factor of 100 for large models). However, the
    algorithm used here (see [2]_) is still more than 1000x faster than the
    "naive" version using `add_loopless(model)`. Also note that if you have
    included constraints that force a loop (for instance by setting all fluxes
    in a loop to be non-zero) this loop will be included in the solution.
