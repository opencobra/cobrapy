    """Runs flux variability analysis to find the min/max flux values for each
    each reaction in `reaction_list`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : a cobra model
        The model for which to run the analysis. It will *not* be modified.
    reaction_list : list of cobra.Reaction or str, optional
        The reactions for which to obtain min/max fluxes. If None will use
        all reactions in the model.
    fraction_of_optimum : float, optional
        Must be <= 1.0. Requires that the objective value is at least
        fraction * max_objective_value. A value of 0.85 for instance means that
        the objective has to be at least at 95% percent of its maximum.
    solver : str, optional
        Name of the solver to be used. If None it will respect the solver set
        in the model (model.solver).
    **solver_args : additional arguments for legacy solver, optional
        Additional arguments passed to the legacy solver. Ignored for
        optlang solver (those can be configured using
        model.solver.configuration).

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A nested dictionary {reaction_id: {minimize/maximize: flux}} giving
        the minimal and maximal flux for each reaction.

    Notes
    -----
    This implements the fast version as described in [1]_. Please note that
    the flux distribution containing all minimal/maximal fluxes does not have
    to be a feasible solution for the model. Fluxes are minimized/maximized
    individually and a single minimal flux might require all others to be
    suboptimal.
