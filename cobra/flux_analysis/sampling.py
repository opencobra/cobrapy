    center : numpy array
        The center of the sampling space as estimated by the mean of all

    Notes
    -----
    ACHR generates samples by choosing new directions from the sampling space's
    center and the warmup points. The implementation used here is the same
    as in the Matlab Cobra Toolbox [2]_ and uses only the initial warmup points
    to generate new directions and not any other previous iterates. This
    usually gives better mixing since the startup points are chosen to span
    the space in a wide manner. This also makes the generated sampling chain
    quasi-markovian since the center converges rapidly.

    Memory usage is roughly in the order of (2 * number reactions)^2
    due to the required nullspace matrices and warmup points. So large
    models easily take up a few GB of RAM.

class OptGPSampler(HRSampler):
    """A parallel optimized sampler.

    A parallel sampler with fast convergence and parallel execution. See [1]_
    for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The cobra model from which to generate samples.
    processes: int
        The number of processes used during sampling.
    thinning : int, optional
        The thinning factor of the generated sampling chain. A thinning of 10
        means samples are returned every 10 steps.
    seed : positive integer, optional
        Sets the random number seed. Initialized to the current time stamp if
        None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The cobra model from which the samples get generated.
    thinning : int
        The currently used thinning factor.
    n_samples : int
        The total number of samples that have been generated by this
        sampler instance.
    problem : collections.namedtuple
        A python object whose attributes define the entire sampling problem in
        matrix form. See docstring of `Problem`.
    warmup : a numpy matrix
        A matrix of with as many columns as reactions in the model and more
        than 3 rows containing a warmup sample in each row. None if no warmup
        points have been generated yet.
    seed : positive integer, optional
        Sets the random number seed. Initialized to the current time stamp if
        None.
    fwd_idx : np.array
        Has one entry for each reaction in the model containing the index of
        the respective forward variable.
    rev_idx : np.array
        Has one entry for each reaction in the model containing the index of
        the respective reverse variable.
    prev : numpy.array
        The current/last flux sample generated.
    center : numpy.array
        The center of the sampling space as estimated by the mean of all
        previously generated samples.

    Notes
    -----
    The sampler is very similar to artificial centering where each process
    samples its own chain. Initial points are chosen randomly from the warmup
    points followed by a linear transformation that pulls the points towards
    the a little bit towards the center of the sampling space.

    If the number of processes used is larger than one the requested
    number of samples is adjusted to the smallest multiple of the number of
    processes larger than the requested sample number. For instance, if you
    have 3 processes and request 8 samples you will receive 9.

    Memory usage is roughly in the order of (2 * number reactions)^2
    due to the required nullspace matrices and warmup points. So large
    models easily take up a few GB of RAM. However, most of the large matrices
    are kept in shared memory. So the RAM usage is independent of the number
    of processes.

        If the number of processes is larger than one, computation is split

        However, there is also overhead in setting up parallel computation so

def sample(model, n, method="optgp", thinning=100, processes=1, seed=None):
    """Sample valid flux distributions from a cobra model.

    The function samples valid flux distributions from a cobra model.
    Currently we support two methods:

    1. 'optgp' (default) which uses the OptGPSampler that supports parallel
        sampling [1]_. Requires large numbers of samples to be performant
        (n < 1000). For smaller samples 'achr' might be better suited.

    or

    2. 'achr' which uses artificial centering hit-and-run. This is a single
       process method with good convergence [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model from which to sample flux distributions.
    n : int
        The number of samples to obtain. When using 'optgp' this must be a
        multiple of `processes`, otherwise a larger number of samples will be
        returned.
    method : str, optional
        The sampling algorithm to use.
    thinning : int, optional
        The thinning factor of the generated sampling chain. A thinning of 10
        means samples are returned every 10 steps. Defaults to 100 which in
        benchmarks gives approximately uncorrelated samples. If set to one
        will return all iterates.
    processes : int, optional
        Only used for 'optgp'. The number of processes used to generate
        samples.
    seed : positive integer, optional
        The random number seed to be used. Initialized to current time stamp
        if None.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        The generated flux samples. Each row corresponds to a sample of the
        fluxes and the columns are the reactions.

    Notes
    -----
    The samplers have a correction method to ensure equality feasibility for
    long-running chains, however this will only work for homogeneous models,
    meaning models with no non-zero fixed variables or constraints (
    right-hand side of the equalities are zero).
