class GapFiller(object):
    """Class for performing gap filling.

    This class implements gap filling based on a mixed-integer approach,
    very similar to that described in [1]_ and the 'no-growth but growth'
    part of [2]_ but with minor adjustments. In short, we add indicator
    variables for using the reactions in the universal model, z_i and then
    solve problem

    minimize \sum_i c_i * z_i
    s.t. Sv = 0
         v_o >= t
         lb_i <= v_i <= ub_i
         v_i = 0 if z_i = 0

    where lb, ub are the upper, lower flux bounds for reaction i, c_i is a
    cost parameter and the objective v_o is greater than the lower bound t.
    The default costs are 1 for reactions from the universal model, 100 for
    exchange (uptake) reactions added and 1 for added demand reactions.

    Note that this is a mixed-integer linear program and as such will
    expensive to solve for large models. Consider using alternatives [3]_
    such as CORDA instead [4,5]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model to perform gap filling on.
    universal : cobra.Model
        A universal model with reactions that can be used to complete the
        model.
    lower_bound : float
        The minimally accepted flux for the objective in the filled model.
    penalties : dict, None
        A dictionary with keys being 'universal' (all reactions included in
        the universal model), 'exchange' and 'demand' (all additionally
        added exchange and demand reactions) for the three reaction types.
        Can also have reaction identifiers for reaction specific costs.
        Defaults are 1, 100 and 1 respectively.
    integer_threshold : float
        The threshold at which a value is considered non-zero (aka
        integrality threshold). If gapfilled models fail to validate,
        you may want to lower this value.
    exchange_reactions : bool
        Consider adding exchange (uptake) reactions for all metabolites
        in the model.
    demand_reactions : bool
        Consider adding demand reactions for all metabolites.
