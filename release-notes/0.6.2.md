# Release notes for cobrapy 0.6.2

## Fixes

- Debug `model.remove_reactions` to properly work with context manager.
  This lead to the deprecation of `reaction.delete` as this was not compatible
  with the concept of being able to later revert the change.
  [#506](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/issues/506),
  [#508](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/pull/508).
- When adding reactions to a model, the reactions with identifiers
  identical to those in the model are
  ignored. [#511](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/issues/511)


## Deprecated features

- `reaction.delete` has been deprecated in favor of
  `reaction.remove_from_model`
