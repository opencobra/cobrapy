# Release notes for cobrapy 0.6.3

## Fixes

- `cobra.flux_analysis.reaction.assess`
  [was broken](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/issues/537)
  following the release of 0.6.0 and has now been fixed (and now with
  unit tests).

## New features

## Deprecated features

- `cobra.flux_analysis.reaction.assess_{precursors,products}` were
  essentially copies of each other and have been merged to
  `cobra.flux_analysis.reaction.assess_component`
