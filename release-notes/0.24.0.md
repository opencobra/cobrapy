# Release notes for cobrapy 0.24.0

## New features

* Gene-protein-reaction association rules are now represented by a structured object `GPR`.
  `Reaction.gene_reaction_rule` still returns a string and a string can be assigned
  to it that will modify the underlying `GPR` instance.
* The `Reaction` class has gained another attribute `Reaction.gpr` which allows direct
  access to the `GPR` instance (#1143).

## Fixes

* Syntax update and type annotations (#1151).
