# Release notes for cobrapy 0.20.0

## New features

* There is a new function inspired by
  [cameo](https://github.com/biosustain/cameo/) that can load models directly
  from [BiGG](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) or
  [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) and by default will cache them
  locally (#995), for example,

    ```py
    from cobra.io import load_model

    ecoli = load_model("iML1515")
    ylipo = load_model("MODEL1604280017")
    ```

## Fixes

* Over a series of pull requests, @synchon has been modernizing parts of the
  codebase for Python 3.6+ (#993, #999, #1000, #1003)
* Upgrade the dependency python-libsbml-experimental to 5.18.3
