    "Classical loopless approaches as described below are computationally expensive to solve due to the added mixed-integer constraints. A much faster, and pragmatic approach is instead to post-process flux distributions to simply set fluxes to zero wherever they can be zero without changing the fluxes of any exchange reactions in the model. [CycleFreeFlux](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv096) is an algorithm that can be used to achieve this and in cobrapy it is implemented in the `cobra.flux_analysis.loopless_solution` function. `loopless_solution` will identify the closest flux distribution (using only loopless elementary flux modes) to the original one. Note that this will not remove loops which you explicitly requested, for instance by forcing a loop reaction to carry non-zero flux. \n",

They are used to force the G proxies to always carry the opposite sign of the flux (as it is the case for the \"real\" $\\Delta G$ values). $N_{int}$ is the nullspace matrix for internal reactions and is used to find thermodinamically \"correct\" values for G. \n"
