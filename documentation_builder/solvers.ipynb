    "A constraints-based reconstruction and analysis model for biological systems is actually just an application of a class of discrete optimization problems typically solved with [linear, mixed integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) or [quadratic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming) techniques. Cobrapy does not implement any algorithms to find solutions to such problems but rather creates an biologically motivated abstraction to these techniques to make it easier to think of how metabolic systems work without paying much attention to how that formulates to an optimization problem.\n",
