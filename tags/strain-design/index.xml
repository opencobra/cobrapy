      <description>DD-DeCaF is a Horizon 2020 project (grant agreement No 686070) bringing together leading academic partners from five European universities with five innovative European companies to address the challenge of building a comprehensive design tool. DD-DeCaF aims to develop cutting edge methods in order to use large scale data to design cell factories and communities for biotechnological applications. The project is built as a number of micro-services which can be used separately and via the web-based user-interface.</description>

      <description>Cameo is a high-level python library developed to aid the strain design process in metabolic engineering projects. The library provides a modular framework of simulation methods, strain design methods, access to models, that targets developers that want custom analysis workflows.
Computationally heavy methods have been parallelized and can be run on a clusters using the IPython parallelization framework (see example and documentation for more details). The default fallback is python&amp;rsquo;s multiprocessing library.</description>
