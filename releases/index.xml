      <description>In this release we have made major changes to pretty much all corners of cobrapy and we hope that you will enjoy the new features as much as we do, and that any negative impacts on existing workflows will be limited.
The major change is the ongoing move away from cobrapy&amp;rsquo;s internal solver interfaces to those provided by optlang which provides a single unified interface to glpk, cplex and gurobi enhanced by the ability to deal with symbolic expressions.</description>
