Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Generally, the following practices are recommended for making
contributions to cobrapy. These aren't all necessarily hard-and-fast
rules, but should serve as guidelines in most cases.

1. Please comment code.
2. All new python code should be pep8 compliant.
3. Please use git best practices, with a 50 line summary for each
   commit. Generally, separate features should be made in separate
   commits so they can be tested and merged independently. For example,
   adding a new solver would be a separate commit from fixing whitespace
   in cobra.core.
4. Documentation is written as IPython/jupyter notebooks in the
   ``documentation_builder`` directory, which are then converted to rst
   by the ``autodoc.sh`` script.
5. Tests are in the ``cobra/test`` directory. They are automatically run
   through continuous integration services on both python 2 and python 3
   when pull requests are made.
6. Please write tests for new functions. Writing documentation as well
   would also be very helpful.
7. Ensure code will work with both python 2 and python 3. For example,
   instead of ``my_dict.iteritems()`` use ``six.iteritems(my_dict)``

Thank you very much for contributing to cobrapy.
